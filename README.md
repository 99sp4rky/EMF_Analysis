# EMF Urban Simulation

This project visualizes electromagnetic field interactions between a 5G tower and an autonomous vehicle in an urban environment.

## Goals
- Simulate real-time signal behavior using 3D fields
- Analyze coverage areas and visualize communication dead zones
- Showcase vehicle-tower connection state based on EMF overlap

## Technologies Used
- **Blender**: EMF geometry, wave animation, visual rendering
- **MATLAB**: Procedural EMF pattern generation, .PLY file export
- **Python (Blender scripting)**: Material and color logic

## Features
- Realistic directional beamforming pattern for 5G tower
- Car field reacts to tower presence with color change
- Custom vertex color encoding for dynamic signal strength
- Animation-ready with wave propagation tied to scene time

## Use Cases
- Autonomous vehicle comms
- Dead zone analysis
- Signal visualization in dense environments
